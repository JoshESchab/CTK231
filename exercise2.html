<b><h4>Lyric: We passed upon the stair.
We spoke of was and when,
although I wasn't there.
He said I was his friend,
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes.
I thought you died alone
a long long time ago</h4></b>

<body>In this image there is a man wearing goggles. 
    This poster was most likley to be hanged up in a workplace environment that uses equipment that could harm your eyes. <br>
     It also has a minimalistic artstyle which gives it an industrial aesthetic. Apparently this poster is only produced in Illinois since it is for the Illinois Safety Division.
